# Paint Clone SDL!
A basic clone of Paint. This repository only contains the source files and the compilation script i use to compile the program faster faster without having to open and close the terminal. I used Dear Imgui + SDL2 to make it i hope you find it interesting! :)

<h2> How to compile and run </h2>
You can either download the compiled version that's down below or download the dependencies (SDL2 + Imgui) and put them the way its written in the batch file called "compile.bat". <br><br>
There should be a folder called "Debug" that contains "run.exe" and you MUST drag the SDL2 .dll files
